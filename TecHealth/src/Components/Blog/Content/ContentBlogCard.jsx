      mainContent:
        "In early 2021, a team of Penn Medicine radiologists began to notice a rise in axillary lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes in the armpits) on multiple types of breast imaging (mammography, ultrasound and MRI)Good news, ultimately – but why was this happening? Why the sudden rise in enlarged lymph nodes in the arm pit?“We suspected a correlation between these abnormal mammograms and the COVID-19 vaccine, but didn't know for sure,” says Christine Edmonds, MD, breast radiologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP).Dr. Edmonds and her team started digging. They reached out and asked the women whether they’d received the COVID vaccine (information that wasn’t necessarily in their medical records), when they received it, and in which arm. Again and again, women reported that they had been vaccinated in the weeks prior to their abnormal mammograms.Clinicians nationwide were reporting similar findings.",

            " Enlargement of lymph nodes in the armpit is a normal reaction to the COVID vaccine, and nothing to worry about. When seen on mammograms, the enlarged nodes related to the vaccine have the potential to be mistaken for signs of breast cancer or other diseases such as lymphoma. The enlarged nodes may cause additional testing, sometimes even biopsies – and therefore, unnecessary stress and anxiety.We perform successful breast biopsies every day, but like any procedure involving a needle, it comes with risk,” Dr. Edmonds says. “So before we biopsy, we want to make sure that risk is justified. Just as importantly, a false positive on a mammogram can induce anxiety in patients and other hassles: Worry, scheduling and attending appointments, biopsy discomfort, the wait for results. We don’t want women to experience any of these things unnecessarily."

Before we discuss SBI’s mammogram guidelines in more detail, let us stress:The COVID-19 vaccines and boosters do not cause breast cancer. The COVID vaccine and subsequent boosters continue to protect against COVID with impressive efficacy. Its adverse events (better known as side effects) are limited almost exclusively to manageable and temporary pain and discomfort. While lymph node swelling experienced by some women post-vaccine can be misinterpreted as cancer, it is not cancer. Quite the opposite, actually: Swelling after the COVID vaccine or booster can actually be considered good."

      mainContent:
        "Preventative care is an often overlooked but an important part of young men’s health. Seeing your doctor once a year for an annual physical can seem like a burden when you’re a healthy teenage boy, but it’s a great opportunity to check in, make sure all is well, and clear you for the upcoming school year, sports season, work, or camp. Yet, unless prompted by their parents, teenage boys and young men are notorious for skipping this visit. Besides performing a physical exam, keeping you up to date with your immunizations, and filling out any forms, the physical is your doctor’s chance to screen for any risk factors to your health. Studies show that the adolescent and young adult years of a young man’s life tend to coincide with a multitude of risky behaviors such as experimentation with alcohol, drugs, sex, supplements, reckless driving, and more. During this stage of development, young people tend to be more impulsive which can have negative consequences for the rest of one’s life. If not screened for and discussed, this “can cause routine health issues to worsen and become larger concerns,” says Kyle Bardet, MD, a doctor in Penn Medicine’s Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Department. “That could lead to the need for more significant healthcare down the line.”",

            "Despite the name of it, your annual exam is more about talking than examining. This once a year visit is meant to make sure you have healthy behaviors and stay well into the future. You should schedule it when you feel well so you have the time to cover all the different areas of your health, not just one or two ailments you have that day.During the visit, you’ll talk about a number of things with your doctor. Remember, this information is confidential and it’s best to be honest! Your doctor will ask you about what’s new in your life, how your general health has been, and then dive into more specific questions.You can expect to discuss your mental health, diet, exercise, any medications or supplements you are taking, and about things that may increase your risk for disease later in life. This is why your doctor asks about things like alcohol, tobacco, vaping, marijuana, and drugs. If you are using any of these substances, your doctor will talk with you about the risks and help create a plan to get you off It can sometimes be hard to discuss dating and sex with your doctor, but it’s a very important part of the visit. Risky sexual activity is one of the leading causes of illness in teenagers. In recent years sexually transmitted disease rates have been increasing! Even if you aren’t sexually active, your doctor may still recommend preventative testing for things such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, or HIV. If you have specific concerns about sexuality, risk for STDs, or prevention medicines against HIV, this is a great time to talk do youYour doctor will also review your vaccines, let you know if any are needed, and review any past blood work. Most young men won’t require blood work at their annual visit, but it is important to check labs like cholesterol every feThen, you’ll have a brief exam. Many young men avoid the doctor because they are nervous about genital exams. Doctors sometimes perform these if you have a concern about your testicle or things don’t seem right down there. Otherwise, rest assured - a genital exam is not necessarily part of your annual visit! However, it is important for young men to screen themselves for testicular cancer on a regular basis. While there isn’t a specific way to do this, doing it the same way and in the shower each month is our recommendation. If you aren’t sure what you are feeling, if something is changing, if you have pain, or if you notice a lump or bump, then you should bring this up with your doctor and ask them for an exam to see if anything is wrong. Problems with the genitals are generally easy to treat when discussed in a timely manner!"

The yearly physical is a great time to get to know your doctor, for your doctor to get to know you, and for you to be able to freely and confidentially discuss any questions you have about your body, your mental health, or your lifestyle. One of Dr. Bardet’s favorite conversations is about the safety of exercise, strength training, and nutritional supplements – something many people don’t even know that they can ask a doctor!“Teen boys are generally less likely to ask questions about things they’re concerned with. Instead, they end up internalizing a lot of it, asking their friends, or relying on bad information from the internet,” Dr. Bardet says. “By developing a relationship with your family doctor, you’ll always have a knowledgeable, trustworthy person you can turn to with almost any concern.Chances are, he adds, if you’re wondering about something, someone else had the same question before you. So, it can be comforting just to learn that you’re not aloneHow to find a doctor who specializes in teenSo, if it’s been a while since you’ve seen a doctor, and the last time you did it was a pediatrician, it might be time to call Penn Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine or look for a doctor in your area who specializes in taking care of young men."

A study also found that a diet loaded with “ultra-processed” foods and added sugars may make you feel more stressed and anxious than you otherwise would.Spend a few minutes Googling meal prep recipes. Once you home in on some you like, set aside a couple hours one afternoon for buying the necessary ingredients and making the meals. The idea is to cook enough to provide yourself (and the rest of your family, if you’re feeling generous) with lunches and dinners for a week."

      mainContent:
        "This is going to surprise a lot of people, but teens should really be getting eight to 10 hours of sleep every night,” says Elizabeth Rainville, PA-C, a physician assistant in Penn Medicine’s Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Department.Why so much? Through age 20, Rainville says, men and women are finishing the advanced stages of puberty and men are still physically growing. These things require a lot of energy, and we restore our energy levels primarily through sleep. Not getting enough sleep may put you at a higher risk of diabetes and long-term heart problems.“Sleep also aids our ability to concentrate,” Rainville says. “We like to say that one of the ‘major jobs of adolescence’ is being a student. If you’re not getting enough sleep, it’s going to make learning more difficult.”Even more, getting enough sleep enables us to better regulate our moods and manage stress. If you’re consistently shorting your sleep, both can quickly feel overwhelming. Prolonged stretches of poor sleep are linked to mental health disorders like anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. They can increase the risk of suicide in teens, too.A lack of sleep also negatively influences the part of our brain that controls impulsive behavior. Lots of studies have been able to draw a direct line between teens who don’t get enough sleep and high-risk behaviors like texting while driving, drunk driving, engaging in unprotected sex, using drugs and alcohol, and carrying a weapon.",

A simple way to try it is to find a quiet corner of your home and set the timer on your phone for 10 minutes. Then sit quietly with your eyes closed and try to focus on your breathing. You don’t need to alter it in any wayInevitably, thoughts are going to distract you.

If you’re feeling lonely, reconnecting with family and friends is critical, but it’s not the only strategy.

Fewer than one out of 100 women who use Nexplanon for a year will get pregnant. A large part of its effectiveness is its ease of use. You can’t forget to take it nor can you use it incorrectly.Nexplanon is a small, thin, flexible implant about the size of a matchstick that’s placed in the arm, just under the skin. It works by using a hormone that prevents sperm from being able to reach an egg for fertilization and can also inhibit the release of an egg from the ovary, protecting you from pregnancy all day every daThe procedure to place and remove Nexplanon is very non-invasive, says Monica Rezk, DO, Penn Medicine’s Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Department. “It’s very simple,” she says. “After the patient’s arm is numbed, the entire procedure takes about 10 seconds.”If it’s done within the first five days of your period, the implant will start working immediately. If you get it at any other point in your cycle, it will need about a week before it begins preventing pregnancy. Use condoms, or another form of birth control, in the meantimeOnce it is placed, Nexplanon is effective for the next three years. At the end of the three years, the implant can be removed and replaced with a new device in a single, easy procedureIf you decide before the three years are over that Nexplanon is not right for you, it can be easily removed, and any potential side effects will be reversed quickly.The most common side effect is irregular bleeding, which is why Dr. Rezk would not typically recommend Nexplanon for those who want to regulate their menstrual cycle without the need for pregnancy prevention. It also should not be used in anyone currently diagnosed with breast cancer.Aside from those exceptions, “overall, it’s absolutely safe over the long term,” Dr. Rezk saysOther potential side effects of contraceptive implants (not Nexplanon, specifically) include weight gain and worsening of acne. In studies, 12 percent of users reported weight gain, although only two to seven percent had the implant removed because of it. About 10 to 14 percent of users told researchers their acne worsened. However, less than two percent stopped using the implant as a result."

            "Dopamine dressing is all about dressing joyfully (Bright colors! Rich textures!) to trigger the release of dopamine, the “happiness hormone.” Spoiler: It can work.Wearing things that make us feel good —  most of us have done this over the years and felt the value of it,” says Ivona Percec, MD, PhD, Associate Director of Penn Cosmetic Surgery at Penn MedicineThe difference today is that dopamine dressing is increasingly intentional and trending —  a key part of a toolkit for improving mental health and self-expression. Another tool that’s gaining momentum in 2022? Cosmetic procedures. Unlike dressing intentionally, though, cosmetic procedures require some careful consideration"

            "In 2021, designer Marc Jacobs posted a post-operative selfie to social media with the caption #LiveLoveLift. More recently, Amy Schumer acknowledged her liposuction procedure alongside a bathing suit pic. “I feel good,” the comedian wrote.The normalization of cosmetic procedures has led to more people undergoing them. Non-surgical procedures in particular are picking up steam as relatively low risk ways of improving appearance.  But before you turn to cosmetic procedures in an effort to boost your happiness, ask yourself the question Dr. Percec asks all prospective patientsWhy“What are you trying to achieve with an intervention?” Dr. Percec asks. “Is it purely anatomical, like, 'I want to smooth out the tip of my nose because it’s crooked and it bothers me?' Or is it driven by something biggerShe points out that a smoother nose can’t revive marriages, get back at high school bullies, or offset other bothersome areas of the body“The idea that cosmetic procedures can unlock happiness is a delicate one,” she says. “Because pinning unrealistic expectations on cosmetic procedures can become a source of regret or a slippery slopeSo is a cosmetic procedure ever a good choice for people looking to feel better about themselves? When expectations are realistic, Dr. Percec says, the answer is yes“Your facial appearance in particular is your identity. For patients with realistic motivations and expectations, small improvements can help them feel their best selves. There's a strong synergy between the body and mind. Today more than ever before, patients have a broader, safer, more natural portfolio of tools to choose from. Making this decision from a grounded place of clarity, it most certainly can boost patients' larger outlook in the near future and for years to comeFor most of us, feeling good was harder these past few years. Luckily, there are more options than ever before for boosting our appearances and, in doing so, potentially boosting our confidence, outlook, and mood. Use your best judgment, have a little fun, and don’t be surprised if the feel-good feelings follow."

Sure, these snacks are enjoyable and may go well with your shows, but they aren’t doing any favors for your waist line. High calorie, high carb, and high fat foods combined with sitting for prolonged periods of time, is a recipe for disaster when it comes to managing your weight.If you’ve noticed you’ve been gaining a lot of weight at a rapid pace, it might be time to trade your TV marathons for some physical activity.

There are so many ways for stress to creep into our lives. We need to be proactive about how we cope with it. Dr. Timko suggests meditation“Apps like Calm and Headspace have reshaped the conversations around meditation and made it much more accessible,” she says. “And you can benefit from doing it just a few minutes a day."

This is the most common form of headache pain. Eyestrain, stress and hunger are frequently causes of tension headaches, and they can be chronic.Sinus headaches: These headaches often strike when you're sick or feeling congested. They're caused by swelling in the sinus passages, resulting in pain behind the cheeks, nose and eyes. The pain is often as its worst when you wake up on the morning and when you bend forward.Cluster headaches: These headaches are usually very painful and occur in clusters, meaning they happen daily (usually at the same time), sometimes up to several times per day for months. They are a result of dilation in the blood vessels of the brain due to a release of serotonin and histamines. They can be caused by physical exertion, bright lights or even altitude"

            "When most people hear the term migraine, they often think of a severe headache. But headaches are only one symptom of migraines, and they can range in severity and length.Migraines are a neurological disease that involve nerve pathways and chemicals, explains Brockman.The changes in brain activity affect blood in the brain and surrounding tissues, causing a range of symptoms. In addition to severe head pain, migraine sufferers may experience some or all of the following symptoms:NauseaIncreased sensitivity to light, sound or smellsDizzinessExtreme fatigueA migraine episode may occur in four different phases, though not everyone experiences every phase. The phases include:Prodrome phase: Sometimes called the pre-headache phase, this stage features painless symptoms that occur hours or days before the migraine arrives. These include mood swings, food cravings and stiffness of the neck.Aura phase: Auras refer to sensory disturbances that occur before or during a migraine. Auras can affect a person's vision, touch or speech, though not everyone who suffers from migraines experiences auras. Examples of auras include blurred visions, blind spots that expand over time, numbness in the arm, and slurred or jumbled speech.Headache phase: This is when the pain usually hits, and it may range from mild to debilitating. Physical activity and exposure to light, sound and smells may worsen the pain. However, some people can have a migraine without developing a headache.Postdromal phase: The final phase is when the pain has subsided. People may feel exhausted, confused or generally unwell during this phase."
